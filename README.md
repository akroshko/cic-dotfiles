akroshko's personal configuration files (dotfiles)
==================================================

These configuration files (dotfiles) used by *akroshko* are provided
as-is.  I have found other people's publicly available configuration
files (dotfiles) useful and hope others will find mine useful.  Since
they have only been tested on several of my computers that all have a
similar configuration, there can be no guarantee that as-is they will
give the desired behaviour on a particular system.

Code in this repository is licensed under the GPLv3, with several
exceptions that are licensed under the GPLv2 where indicated.  Files
without a license header, generally where adding this is incompatible
with the file type or would make routine editing of the file awkward,
are GPLv3 licensed.
