# GIMP gimprc
#
# This is your personal gimprc file.  Any variable defined in this file takes
# precedence over the value defined in the system-wide gimprc:
# /etc/gimp/2.0/gimprc
# Most values can be set within GIMP by changing some options in the
# Preferences dialog.

# Sets the folder for temporary storage. Files will appear here during the
# course of running GIMP.  Most files will disappear when GIMP exits, but
# some files are likely to remain, so it is best if this folder not be one
# that is shared by other users.  This is a single folder.
#
# (temp-path "${gimp_dir}/tmp")

# Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation
# scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk
# and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP
# is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap
# file is created on a folder that is mounted over NFS.  For these reasons,
# it may be desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".  This is a single
# folder.
#
# (swap-path "${gimp_dir}")

# Sets how many processors GIMP should try to use simultaneously.  This is an
# integer value.
#
(num-processors 2)

# When the amount of pixel data exceeds this limit, GIMP will start to swap
# tiles to disk.  This is a lot slower but it makes it possible to work on
# images that wouldn't fit into memory otherwise.  If you have a lot of RAM,
# you may want to set this to a higher value.  The integer size can contain a
# suffix of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes GIMP interpret the size as being
# specified in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is
# specified the size defaults to being specified in kilobytes.
#
# (tile-cache-size 1034406k)

# Sets the default image in the "File/New" dialog.  This is a parameter list.

# Sets the minimal number of operations that can be undone. More undo levels
# are kept available until the undo-size limit is reached.  This is an
# integer value.
#
(undo-levels 10)

# Sets an upper limit to the memory that is used per image to keep operations
# on the undo stack. Regardless of this setting, at least as many undo-levels
# as configured can be undone.  The integer size can contain a suffix of 'B',
# 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes GIMP interpret the size as being specified in
# bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the
# size defaults to being specified in kilobytes.
